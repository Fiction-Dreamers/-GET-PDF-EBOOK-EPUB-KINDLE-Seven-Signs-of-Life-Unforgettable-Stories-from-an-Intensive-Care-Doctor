Title: DoctorsHaveFeelings
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2020
Review: I liked this book written by a female doctor in Britain. We get so used to thinking doctors have all the answers; that they never get emotional, exhausted, drained or experience conflict when their oath to serve patients is at odds with their sense of morality. This book puts the reader there. Asks the questions that doctors ask themselves sometimes like "Is this the right decision - not from a medical perspective but from a moral perspective?" I felt this book humanized the ICU doctor in a way that is particularly important to understand in this era of a global pandemic because once you realize how difficult things can be under normal circumstances, you can really appreciate what these doctors and nurses must be going through now.

Title: Thoughtprovoking
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020
Review: This well written recounting of what it is like to be a doctor in the British ER ward was not only interesting with lots of examples of patient cases but insight into those who work there. What I found most compelling was facing death and how to deal with families who are faced with the impeding dead of a loved one. The doctor was compassionate while still being realistic. I left with a much great appreciation of the doctors and nurse who serve humanity with kindness and compassion at the worst moment of most people's lives.

Title: Inspiring
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021
Review: I wasn't sure quite what to expect from this book - I picked it up because in some ways I thought it would resemble my memoir, only told from the doctor's perspective. It wasn't that exactly - or rather, it was that and more. The stories of this doctor, working in the intensive care department of a British hospital are by turns heart-wrenching and inspiring. How this doctor helps patients facing death could have been depressing, but wasn't. If the British aren't grateful for the National health service after reading this - they should be. This was written before COVID, and I can only imagine that the situation has become almost intolerable, and yet people like Dr. Abbey keep working, all around the world.

Review: Accounts of a doctor's experiences of life and death and how she copes with everything that happens to patients in a hospital. These stories of their experiences teach us what doctors encounter and how they deal with it.

Review: I enjoyed the stories and the perspective the author provided. The author was able to find meaning in each encounter. As a retired family doctor, I also tried to allow myself the full range of emotional response all while maintaining the ability to keep functioning, without feeling overwhelmed

Review: The expectations were similar to books like ‚ÄòWhen breath becomes air‚Äô and the books by Atul Gawande. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt meet the expected standard to be comparable to those books.
